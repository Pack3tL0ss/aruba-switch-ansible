# This Task is an example on how to use the custom SSH CLI Module for AOS-Switch from this Project
# It supports show commands as well as executing multiple commands
# It does not support commands that have prompts currently


# This Task will function in a similar workflow as all other tasks.
# In this example IP, username and password are all variables from the Playbook which includes the task.
# You will have to pass all variables to the Module



- name: Execute CLI commands
  arubaos_switch_ssh_cli:
    ip: "{{ ip }}"
    user: "{{ user }}"
    password: "{{ password }}"
    # This is a list of commands that create a self singed certificate and enroll SSL for your Switch.
    command_list: ["conf t","crypto pki enroll-self-signed certificate-name ztpcert key-type rsa key-size 1024 subject common-name ztp_cert","web-management ssl"]
  # This result does not return CLI Outputs
  register: result





- name: Check if upload is completed
  arubaos_switch_ssh_cli:
    ip: "{{ ip }}"
    user: "{{ user }}"
    password: "{{ password }}"
    # This will execute each command through the CLI and return the CLI Output
    show_command: ["show flash", "show version"]
  # Saves the results from the module call into variable result_cli_output
  register: result_cli_output

# The result will have a key called "cli_output" which is a list of results from the executed command
# This list will the output for each command that got executed (command in show_command list)
# You can acces it through the index which starts at zero

# This will print out the result of the show flash output
- debug:
    msg: "'show flash' Output: {{ result_cli_output.cli_output[0] }}"

# This will print out the result of the show version output
- debug:
    msg: "'show version' Output: {{ result_cli_output.cli_output[1] }}"




## Overall the following variables for this module are possible:
#- name: All possible Options explaind
#  arubaos_switch_ssh_cli:
#    ip: "" # String of the IP that you want to connect to. Required
#    username: "" # String of the username for SSH connection. Required
#    password: "" # String of the password for the SSH connection. Required (Will not be logged by Ansible)
#    # You can enter one or both of the following attributes. The Module will execute either and change the result body accordingly
#    command_list: ["command1", "command2"] # List of strings of commands, will return not CLI output and is faster then show command
#    show_command: ["command1", "command2"] # List of strings of commands, will return CLI Output to result body. Can also have non show command or mode switches
#    # If command_list or show_command are not specified, the module will just login and logout via ssh.
#
#    # Following are optional parameters which let you change the SSH connection setup
#    port: 22 # Port for SSH connection, default 22
#    timeout: 60 # Timeout for response on SSH connection, default 60
#    allow_agent: False # Set False to disable connect tio SSH Agent, default False
#    key_filename: "path_to_file" # the filename, or list of filenames, of optional private key(s) and/or certs to try for authentication, default None
#  # This allows you to get a JSON Object of the Module return
#  register: result
